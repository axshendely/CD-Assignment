### 1. three components of the solution

1-	Actions
Actions are a set of code scripts that are designed to automate tasks and integrate with other tools and services. Actions can be used to build, test, deploy, and more. Actions are often packaged as reusable workflows that can be shared with other developers.

2-	SSH keys
SSH keys, short for Secure Shell keys, are a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate with remote systems over the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The SSH keys consist of a public key and a private key. The private key is kept on the local system and is used to authenticate with remote systems that have the corresponding public key added to the authorized keys file. SSH keys are commonly used for secure communication and remote access to servers and other systems.

3-	Secrets
Secrets are sensitive pieces of data that are used in software development workflows but should not be exposed to the public. Secrets can include passwords, API keys, access tokens, and other sensitive information. Secrets can be stored securely using various tools and services and can be accessed by Actions during a workflow to authenticate with external services or to perform other secure operations.

### 2. some problems


1-	*“No CreditCard”*
	
2-	*"No Server"*

3-	*...*

<br>
when I started looking for a decent solution for not having a credit card for a server, I bought a server with bitcoin (so no digital ocean droplet) but it went fine once I had my server I knew how to proceed would come along!
all my problems solved by using crypto to buy a server and go through the steps!
now i understand how i would commit my project, 
so that the changes flow directly to the server.
